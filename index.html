        <div class="short-info wow fadeInUp">
        <p>Senior year of college has been a year of immense personal growth for me. I hope to look back on this year and appreciate the sense of empowerment I felt growing within me over time. A couple of key life events have caused me to have to reevaluate myself and my values: I broke up with a boyfriend of 4 years, I choose to not accept a return offer to Google where I would be the only woman on my team and I lost in a race for president  for a campus organization in a highly contentious election. The combination of these events have placed me in a position where, for the first time, I was confronted with my own femininity and forced me to think about what it means to be a woman in each of these situations. I began asking myself questions such as:</p>
        </div>

        <ul class="list-check">
            <li>What does it mean to be a single woman in society today? </li>
            <li>What facets of my personality have I been covering for and compensating for while in a relationship?</li>
            <li>What are the key aspects I will not compromise on when securing a job post graduation?</li>
            <li>What personal and professional skills must I develop to become a better woman leader?</li>
            <li>What can I do when confronted with sexist behavior and how might I be an ally for other women around me?</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <div class="short-info wow fadeInUp">
        <p>These existential questions and subsequent recommendations from fellow students have led me to enroll in UGBA192T in the first place, and now have allowed me to reflect and begin to build goals for myself in all of these realms.</p>

        <p>I realized one aspect of my personality I have allowed to slip over the course of a long term relationship was my creative side. I was covering a huge part of myself for another person, and after some reflection, I've challenged myself to carve out a creative space where I can get back to my artistic side. I've been carrying around a sketchbook and taking time to sketch and journal. I've been experimenting with sketching many shapes of trees. Trees and how they transcend and form different shapes and forms fascinate me since each drawing can carry special meaning or just simply take the form of a plain tree.</p>

        <p> The sketches associated with each section below reflect my state of mind as I was thinking about my personal leadership strategy, and I haven't shared them with anyone prior. I hope they make sense not just to me in my own head.</p>

              <!-- <h3>Family First</h3> -->
              <p>In Ukrainian culture, a woman's place in society is not necessarily on an equal footing with that of a man. For a long time, that mentality led me to struggle with my identity. Am I Ukrainian if I dissociate with much of the culture of my family? Am I Israeli since that's where I was born and raised? Or maybe I'm American since my teenage experience was shaped by American Ideals. </p>

I know that with patience I can successfully navigate external expectations for women with my own goals and ambition. </p>

            <h3>Right != Effective</h3>
            <p>I've become to realize that especially when it comes to family, right is not always effective. This was more obvious to me than ever after I ended my first ever long term relationship to the shock and criticism of my extended family. I have learned that it's important to pick my battles while maintaining healthy relationships despite familial disagreements. </p>

               <p>Having reflected on the familial context that have contributed to many aspects of my personality, I recognized I needed to further identify my values and establish my personal brand for the sake of my success in the future.

              <!-- <h3>Family First</h3> -->

              <p>In class, two key lectures really stuck with me. First when I was forced to think about my personal board of directors, and second when I had the opportunity to define my personal brand. When I narrowed my words down, I came up with <strong>kind</strong>, <strong>authentic</strong> and <strong>bold</strong>. </p> 
            <br>

            <div class="short-info wow fadeInUp">
              <h3>My Personal Board of Directors</h3>
              <p>I wanted to test my own evaluation of my personal brand and identify how others view me. Narrowing down who I feel comfortable reaching out to and whose input I value most was a really valuable exercise. Some of the feedback I got included: you’re a rock for the people you care deeply about ⁃ you live in the moment, and thrive on spontaneity ⁃ you’re driven and persistent. </p> 

              <p>Hearing and thinking through this feedback, I decided I stand by the original three words I came up with. I am feeling more empowered than ever to double down on my personal commitments:</p>

          <p>Once organized in this way, the takeaways become pretty obvious in terms of areas where I need to improve. I've already known I need to become more confident in the workplace, and work on my stress management, but listening to my closest group of mentor, family and friends evaluate me in these categories helped me see my weaknesses clearly. </p>

          <p>My personal goal for 2018 is to work on balance. I know starting my first job will be stressful, but I must allocate time in my days for self care. My professional goal is to shush the tiny voice inside my head saying "I can't." Recognizing moments of imposter syndrome is the first step to switching the mindset from "I can't" to "I can and I will."</p>

              <!-- <h3>Family First</h3> -->
              <p>In fall 2017, I lost an election for the role of president. It was a role I cared deeply about. Running against a man who decided to actively step away from the organization in prior semesters and take a step back on his leadership responsibilities, I felt like the outcome of the election should have been different. The feedback over the course of deliberations was that I am too intense; that my goals for the club are too ambitious. In the moment, I was really crushed by the outcome, and looking back 6 month removed from the situation, I still believe there were sexist tones in the room I really disagree with.</p>

              <h3>Embracing Discomfort</h3>
              <p>That experience showed me first hand that there are still many barriers to women in leadership roles. After all, what is the real world going to be like if I notice these patterns in a group of 30 highly ambitious Berkeley students. However, as Sheryl Sandberg explains in <i>Lean In</i>, I must commit to being uncomfortable and putting myself in positions where I am uncertain of the outcome. After the election, a fellow woman told me she was disappointed by the result, but not surprised as she believes I should get used to situation like this. I refuse to accept that mentality, and I am ready to embrace the discomfort it will take to shift that framework in the professional world.</p>

            <h3>You can be what you can see</h3>
            <p>Attending the Grace Hopper conference for Women Technologists was a pivoting moment in my college career. For the first time, I saw other women doing what I aspire to do when I graduate. It was such an inclusive and welcoming space and it empowered me to want to become one of these women. It's my goal to not only "be" what I am seeing, but also increase the visibility of women in tech for the generation after me. Surrounding myself with a circle of aspirational figures will also allow me to embrace discomfort and navigate complex situations more favorably. </p>

        <div class="short-info wow fadeInUp">
        <p>So what does it mean to be a single woman in society today? It means I am challenging myself to embrace my femininity and sexuality. It means I will bring my entire self to work, and refuse to cover key aspects of my personality for other people. I am going to lean into the conversation, and when necessary, start my own conversation about these topics. And most importantly, I will surround myself with people that support me in this mission (✿◠‿◠✿)</p>
